# ⚽ Football Team Cards

An interactive web application that showcases a football team's roster with stylish player cards and filtering features.  
Built with **HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript** as part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge.

## 📖 Overview
The **Football Team Cards** project displays a team roster with player cards that include details like **name, position, jersey number, and nickname**.  
It also features **filtering functionality** so users can easily sort players by position, nickname, or see the full roster.  

This project combines **array methods (map, filter)** with **DOM manipulation** to dynamically render player cards. The design uses a football-inspired theme to create an immersive and fun experience.
